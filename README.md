# Smart Security System (LightSense)

This is a hardware-based smart home security prototype designed to mimic systems like Ring or ADT. It was built using a Raspberry Pi and various sensors to detect motion and distance, triggering lighting and potential alarms in response.

## 👨‍💻 My Role
I helped design and build the prototype, integrated the sensors, and worked on the Python logic for motion detection. I also collaborated on wiring the breadboard and testing the sensor response system.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Raspberry Pi (Python-based)
- PIR Motion Sensor
- Ultrasonic Distance Sensor
- Infrared LED lights
- Breadboard & jumper wires

## 📦 Project Features
- Motion detection via PIR sensor
- Distance sensing via ultrasonic module
- Lights triggered by detection
- Real-time sensor feedback on Raspberry Pi

## 🌱 Future Plans
- Add camera module and recording
- Cloud alerts via SMS/email
- Mobile app interface
